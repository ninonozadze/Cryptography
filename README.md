# Cryptography Assignments & Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to several applied cryptography assignments and challenges.
The projects cover a range of topics, including block-cipher attacks, message-authentication vulnerabilities, discrete logarithms and RSA signature manipulation.

All implementations follow the assignment rules and are written in pure Python, without external cryptographic libraries.
*Each directory includes the assignment description*, supporting scripts and my solution code.
