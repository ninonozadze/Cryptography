# Cryptography Assignments & Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to several applied cryptography assignments and challenges.

The projects cover a range of topics, including block-cipher attacks, message-authentication vulnerabilities, discrete logarithms and RSA signature manipulation.

All implementations follow the assignment rules and are written in pure Python, without external cryptographic libraries.

__Each directory includes the assignment description__, supporting scripts and my solution code.
